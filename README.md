Kingdom of Loathing (KoL) Lair Item Spoiler for greasemonkey

This script was originally written by Retrofrog (http://retrofrog.hardcoreoxygenation.com/kol/) and I used it for many years. As Jick went through old KoL zones and revamped them, zonenumbers changed and the script became increasingly incorrect. Finally, GreaseMonkey 2.0 broke all scripts that didn't have @grant lines for greasemonkey functions and KoLMafia changed from using 127.0.0.1 to using localhost. 

With the help of xKiv on the Mafia forums I was able to fix the script to be compatible with GM2.0, but I figured while I was in there I'd update all the locations. It took a while, and I'm sure other people would find it useful, so I'm releasing it here. If retrofrog comes back and wants to continue maintaining the script, I'll gladly hand over control.
